// RUBRIC BEHAVIOUR FINGERPRINT — behaviour measured, not declared.
//
// `rubricVersion` is a name the author controls. It says which rubric the author BELIEVES ran;
// it cannot say how that rubric behaved. On 2026-09-15 five changes altered scoring under
// `witan-rubric-v17-2026-07-24` — the calibrated public default — with the identifier unchanged,
// and the control that exists to catch a silent re-score is keyed on the identifier, so it was
// correct to stay quiet. Two certificates could carry the same rubric name, be produced at the
// same revision by different tool versions, and disagree, with nothing in either artifact saying
// why.
//
// The fingerprint closes that. It is the sha256 of the scoring-relevant output of a fixed,
// committed corpus of synthetic repositories (src/witan/__tests__/fixtures/behaviour-corpus.ts)
// scored under one rubric. It moves if, and only if, that rubric's scoring behaviour moves on a
// shape the corpus contains. It is a BEHAVIOURAL identity, orthogonal to the rubric's NAME:
// the pair (rubricVersion, rubricBehaviourFingerprint) is what a holder of two certificates can
// actually compare.
//
// What it is NOT: a coverage claim. A fingerprint that matches says no corpus-visible scoring
// behaviour changed. It cannot say that scoring did not change on a shape the corpus does not
// contain — see the corpus file for which criteria are measured and which are not reachable at
// all through a repository scan. Recall gaps are a known and priced-in limitation here exactly
// as they are everywhere else in this tool; a false assertion is not.

/**
 * Project a report down to what the rubric decided, and nothing else.
 *
 * INCLUDED — criterion scores, criterion statuses (which is where `insufficientData` surfaces:
 * `scoreCriterion` maps an abstaining signal to status `insufficient_data`), the report-level
 * abstention reason, `contentReadSummary` (the reason side of an abstention, and an input to the
 * composite denominator), metric values, per-severity finding counts, the archetype, and every
 * composite score.
 *
 * EXCLUDED, deliberately:
 *   - everything per-invocation: `productSlug`, `productDisplayName`, `repo` (path, url, headSha),
 *     `generatedAt`, `toolVersion`, and the fingerprint field itself. These differ between two
 *     honest runs of the same scanner and would make the digest useless.
 *   - `rubricVersion` itself. Putting the identifier inside the digest would let a rename move a
 *     number that is supposed to mean "behaviour moved", which is the whole defect this exists to
 *     answer. The consequence is deliberate: two rubrics that behave identically on this corpus
 *     get identical fingerprints, and that equality is a true statement about them.
 *   - prose: finding summaries, metric labels/units/descriptions, evidence labels, criterion
 *     titles and notes, `scanLimitations`. A wording improvement is not a scoring change, and a
 *     guard that fires on copy edits is a guard people learn to re-pin without reading. A finding
 *     APPEARING or DISAPPEARING still moves the severity counts, so the detector change is caught
 *     while the sentence it produces stays editable.
 *   - evidence pointers. Their paths are fixture-relative and their content hashes restate file
 *     content the fixture already pins.
